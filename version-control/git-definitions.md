# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control records changes made in a file. Version control is useful because it allows you to view which changes were made to a file and track when changes were made or where something went wrong.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a set of code that diverts from the main one in order to fix a bug or add a feature. Branching allows for developers to code simultaneously as well as providing a way to make updates to the code without breaking the master code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit adds the code to the master file. A good commit message is descriptive enough for a person to read and understand the basic change made to the code.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the branch that has been updated tries to merge into another branch, but the other branch has additional code that is different.
