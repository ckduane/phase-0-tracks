<p>There is a very <em>small</em> fly on my laptop screen. The lights must be so <strong>bright</strong>. My fast typing scared the small fly away. The fly was cute because it was small, but it could not compare to <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/02/90/54/02905432ca5dc58a0d25596cf9c8b800.jpg">these flies</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a nifty list of flies that were not as cute as the one on my screen:</p>

	<li>horse fly</li>
	<li>bot fly</li>
	<li>deer fly</li>
	<li>scorpion fly</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are pretty flies worth looking at if you have the time</p>
